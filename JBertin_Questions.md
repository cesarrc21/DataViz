 # Semiology of graphs_J.Bertin
 ***Chapter 1***

1. How could be define the "Graphic representation"?
As a “language”for the eye, graphics benefit from the ubiquitous properties of visual perception. 

2. When a system is considered monosemic?
A system is monosemic when the meaning of each sign is known prior to observation of the collection of signs.

3. What is known as the inaviant?
It is all the correspondences observed within a finite set of variational concepts of “components" which are related to an invariable common ground.

4. What are the two functions of headings (legend and title) in a graphic image? 
The external identification(to identify the components through the mind) and internal identification(identify the visual variables through the drawing).

5. What is needed to identify the invariant?
In all cases, a written term is needed to define the invariant

6. Do Maps tend to cantain more components?
True. A map often involves several additional components.

7. How do components can be characterized?
As qualitatives (or nominal) when its categories are not orderen in a universal manner;  as ordered, when categories have an order; and, as quantitative(internal-ratio) when the variation in distance is specify.




***Chapter 2***

1. What is the function of marks?
Marks express a correspondence between the two series constituted by the two planar dimensions of the graph.

2. In what a mark could vary?
In its sizer, value, texture, color, orientation and shape.

3. What are the characteristics of visual variables of position?
They are selective, associative, quantitative, ordered, and have length.

4. What are the three types of identification in a graph?
The point, line ad area.

5. How much are the groups of representation of imposition?
They are four: Diagrams, networks, maps and symbols. 

6. When Associative perception is consider as 'useful'?
Ans: Associative perception is useful when one is seeking to equalize a variation, and to group correspondences with all categories of this variation combined.


***Chapter 3***

1. According to Image theory, How  'efficiency' is defined?
Ans: It is defined by the following proposition:If, in order to obtain a correct and complete answer to a given question, all other things being equal, one construction requires a shorter observation time than another construction, we can say that it is more efficient for this question.

2. In what consist Zipf's notion of'mental cost'?
Ans: This notion comes into play only when the drawing is utilized to semantic ends, that is, when the readerasks a precise question.

3. What does knowledge means in graphic context?
Ans: Knowledge involves a continuing effort of comparison, which means that one objective of any new information is to enter into the most extensive possible interplay of comparisons.

4. What is the first rule of graphic construction?
Ans: To represent the information in a single image, or in the minimum number of images necessary.
