# Questions about Tufte's book.

***Chapter_1***

1. Does the inconsistency among the data affect the interpretation of the graphs?
Ans: Yes, it affect because if the data is not solid and clear it could modify the interpretations of graphs.

2. What is the optimal amount of data that can be graphed?
Ans: To represent a graph visually undertandable, is a good practice to take the most relevant data, remember that data must be clear and true to say through graphs the information and avoid outliers.
 
3. How relevant are the dimensions in the graphs to explain the data?
Answ: Dimensions in visualization help to get diffeent views of the graph to improve the comprehension of viewers, that is why more dimension could be better in some cases.

4. The higher the density of the information, the better will be the visualization of the data?
Ans: It implies a more extence process of analysis but in most cases get more density of information help to improve results.

5. Does graphic excellence guarantee veracity?
Ans: graphic exellence implies that data must be clear and true, but we not always could trust that a grahps that is called exellent is truthful.


***Chapter_2***

1. In a graph, does the information or visualization matter more?
Ans: Both are important but having poorly data could affect visualization, so, information is first.  

2. Distortion and visual effects improve or worsen visualizations?
Ans: It could help to beatify visualiozation experince, but somethimes minus is more.

3. In a graph, do you have to be so careful with the information (detail of numbers, for example)?
Ans: Yes, due to artist who made visualization not always are who made statistics, data could be define correctly to get graphics in the same way.

4. Is the ambiguity in the graphics bad?
Yes, if the visualization has different paths where viewers determine what it is saying, the information is not solid to present the definition correctly.

5. Are data out of context always false?
Most of times. think about outliers, if we get data separately of a center of data, those outliers made irrelevant to our porpuses.


***Chapter_3***
1. Are statistical data boring?
Ans: Statistical data is not boring. Common failure of graphical display is assuming that the purpose of the display is to be non-boring or to dumb data down for readers.

2. What are the words which composed the Big Think jargon?
Ans: "creative", "concept" and "style"

3. What does make a graphic simple and clear? 
Ans: That is just use the necessary information to be visualized, "if you have to explain it, dont put it".

4. What does graphical sophistication refers to? Variety of measure
Ans: Graphical sophistication of a publication is the percentage of statistical graphics based on more than one variable, but not a time-series or map.

5. What does produce graphic mediocrity?
Ans: It is produced due to the lack of substantive and quantitativw skills of illutrators


****Chapter_4***
1. What is the fundamental principle of good statistical graphics? 
Ans: The fundamental principle say: -"Above all else show the data".

2. What is the formula to calculate just data-ink? 
Ans: Solving for data-ink, the formula is: (Data-ink ratio * Total ink used to print the graphic)

3. What is the adecuate quantity of ink on graphics?
It varies but data-ink could be maximized to 10-20%.

4. What are the two erasing principles?
Ans: The two principle explained in the chapter are refer as: "Erase non data-ink, within reason" and "Erase redundant data-ink, within reason".


***Chapter_5***

1. What is the purpose of graphical decoration?
Ans: The purpose of decoration varies. To make the graphic appear more scientific and precise, to enliven the display, to give the designer an opportunity to exercise artisticskills.

2. Does Charjunks always are relevant on graphics?
Ans: A hundred chartjunky examples from comercial and media have been forgone, but they are not always necessay to be implemented.

3. How do morir√© effects intereact in visualizations?
Ans: The design interacts with the physiological tremor of the eye to produce the distracting appearance of vibration and movement.

4. Does grid is necessary for graphs? What kind of grid is made up of chartjunks? 
Ans: No it is not always necessary, chartjunks use "Dark grid lines".

5. What are the symtoms of the syndrome We-Used -A-Computer-to-Build-A-Duck?
Ans: The thin substance, the clotted, the pointlessly ordered cross-hatching; the optical vibration.


***Chapter_6***
1. What is the purpose of data ink maximization?
Ans: Create data undestandable visualized as simple as possible.

2. Is it better to decorate graphics with chartjunks?
Ans: No, most of times it is not necessary, remember that sometimes minus is more, so a simple graphic can be clear.

3. Who was the author whom introduce the "range bar"?
Ans: Mary Eleanor Spear 

4. Which are two fundamental graphical designs dot-dash-plot combines?
Ans: Marginal frequency distribution and the bivariate distribution


***Chapter_7***
1. What is the danger of multifunctioning elements?
Ans: That they tend to generate graphical puzzles, with encodings that can only be broken by their inventor.

2. What is the data measure?
Ans: The graphical element that actually locates or plots the data.

3. What is the data-based grid?
Ans: It is a shrewd grphical device,serving rather than fighting with the data. It is a technique underused in contemporary graphical work.

4. What could be consider as a sure sign of a puzzle?
Ans: That the graphic must be interpreted through a verbal rather than a visual process.

5. What was the method of coloring ingenious in idea but not very satisfactory in practice?
Ans: The mountain-to-the sea method.


***Chapter_8***
1. How can we visualize density?
Ans: Taking into account the size of the graphic in relation to the amount of data displayed.

2. What is the purpose of High-density?
Ans: It help us to compare parts of the data by displaying much information within the view of the eye.

3. In what does the Shrink priciple consist?
Ans: Graphics can be shrunk way down. The way to increase data density is to reduce the area of graphic.

4. How much data graphics could be reduced?
Ans: Many data graphics can be reduced in area to half their currently published size with virtually no loss in legibility and information.



***Chapter_9***

1. What are the two key elements of a good design?
Ans: Graphical elegance is often found in simplicity of design and complexity of data.

2. What are characteristics of attractive displays of statistical information? (Mention at least 2)
Ans: Have a properly chosen format and design; use words, numbers,and drawing together; reflect a balance, a sense of relevant scale; display an accessible complexity of detail; avoid content-free decoration, including chartjunk.
  
3. What is the best way to show numerical values?
Ans: Tables are clearly the best way to show exact numerical values, although the entries can also be arranged in semi-graphical form.

4. What is the data/text integration principle?
Ans: Data graphics are paragraphs about data and should be treated as such.

5. What does the friendly data graphic consist?
Ans: Displays such care in design that it is particularly accessible and open to the eye,as if the designer had the viewer in mind at every turn while constructing the graphic.
